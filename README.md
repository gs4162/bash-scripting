# Bash Scripting Projects

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts developed while following the [Udemy Bash Scripting Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-shell-scripting-projects/). The scripts are designed to automate various system administration tasks, including folder creation, system diagnostics, user creation, and more.

## Project Overview

### 1. **`find-docker-compose-update.sh`**
- **Description**: This script searches for Docker Compose files across the system and helps identify files that might need updates. It is useful for keeping your Docker Compose projects up-to-date.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./find-docker-compose-update.sh
  ```

### 2. **`folder-creation.sh`**
- **Description**: Automates the creation of multiple directories at once, either based on user input or a predefined list. It’s helpful for organizing projects or setting up folder structures quickly.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./folder-creation.sh
  ```

### 3. **`organize_media.sh`**
- **Description**: Organizes media files (images, videos, etc.) into categorized folders based on file types. This is handy for cleaning up disorganized media directories.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./organize_media.sh
  ```

### 4. **`random-password-gen.sh`**
- **Description**: A simple script to generate random passwords with customizable length and complexity options. This can be useful for system admins who need to quickly generate strong passwords for users or services.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./random-password-gen.sh
  ```

### 5. **`system-diagnostics.sh`**
- **Description**: This script runs basic system diagnostics, providing information on CPU, memory usage, disk space, and more. It’s great for quickly gathering key system stats.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./system-diagnostics.sh
  ```

### 6. **`user-creation.sh`**
- **Description**: Automates the process of creating multiple users on a system with specific parameters. It’s useful for system administrators needing to create users in bulk.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./user-creation.sh
  ```

### 7. **`logs/` Directory**
- **Description**: This folder is used for storing logs generated by some of the scripts. For example, the `system-diagnostics.sh` script could save system health logs here for later review.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gs4162/bash-scripting.git
   cd bash-scripting
   ```

2. **Make Scripts Executable**:
   Ensure all scripts have execute permissions. You can set this using:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Desired Script**:
   Execute any script by running:
   ```bash
   ./script-name.sh
   ```
   Replace `script-name.sh` with the actual script you wish to run, such as `./system-diagnostics.sh`.

4. **Review Logs**:
   Some scripts generate logs stored in the `logs/` directory. Navigate to this folder to review any log files:
   ```bash
   cd logs
   ls
   ```

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
- **Bash**: Version 4.0 or higher
- **Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute scripts and perform system-level tasks.

## Customization

### 1. **Usage Instructions**
You can expand the usage instructions by adding detailed examples or real-world scenarios where the scripts can be applied. For instance, demonstrate how `user-creation.sh` can be integrated into a larger user management workflow.

### 2. **Enhance Script Descriptions**
If any scripts include advanced features such as options or flags, update their descriptions to reflect these capabilities. For example, if `random-password-gen.sh` supports different character sets, include that information.

### 3. **Add Examples**
Include example outputs for some scripts to illustrate what users can expect. For instance, show sample output from `system-diagnostics.sh` to highlight the kind of system information it provides.
